## About This Project

Hello there! My name is **Rachel Heiss**, and I’m a home-schooled sophomore in high school. I made this as the final project for [Kane’s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info), which was an intensive and very helpful course. I learned everything I needed to know for this project in 3 weeks and then took about a week to make it. I took a while brainstorming what to do for this project and bounced between a few different options, but since I've always loved musicals and plays I decided to look at Broadway ticket prices and the fullness of theatres over a 37-year period to see how Broadway has changed from 1985 to present-day.
